            <h3>Guidelines</h3>
            <p>
                You have 60 seconds to complete as many equations as you can. There are two difficulty levels, easy and normal. 
                You get 1 point for correctly answering an easy question and 2 points for a normal equation. You can change between 
                the difficulty levels during the 60 seconds, just click on the corresponding button and it will display that 
                difficulty repeatedly until changed.
