            <p>
                You have 60 seconds to complete as many equations as you can. There are two difficulty levels, Easy and Normal. 
                You get 1 point for correctly answering an Easy equation and 2 points for a Normal equation. The default difficulty 
                is Normal. You can change between the difficulty levels during the 60 seconds, just click on the corresponding button 
                and it will display that difficulty repeatedly until changed.
