This website hopes to make algebra both fun and relaxed. The website has an encouraging and easy going approach to the ways it interacts with the user.

- The Game Section
    - This is where the game will be played. It included multiple buttons, to start the game, reset the game, choose difficulty (easy or normal) and submit their answer.
    - Before the game starts, the only button which is enabled and clickable is the start button. This encourages the user to click the button to find out what happens.

- Timer
    - The timer is triggered by clicking the Start button and can be reset at any point after then with the Reset button.
    - The Start button will be made disabled whilst the timer is running, so users cannot launch two timers at once.
    - The Reset button is disabled until the start button is clicked and can be clicked anytime whilst the timer is running.
    - The timer itself is hidden from view until the Start button is clicked. At that point, the timer will start running and show between the Start and Reset buttons.

- Difficulty Section
    - The difficulty section shows us two buttons, easy and normal. Allowing users to choose which difficulty they'd like to be challenged with.


    
    - The easy difficulty is always a random number between 1-5 multiplied by the value of 'n' which is a random number that is calculated in the javascript and not on view to the user.
    - The normal difficulty is always random number between 1-12 multiplied by the value of 'n' then with a random operator (either + or -) which adds or subtracts a secondary random number between 1-10.
