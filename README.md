# Algebra Penguins

Algebra Penguins is a website game for people to practice algebra. It is aimed at beginner learners and those whom would like to relearn or practice some mental arithmatic. This website hopes to make algebra both fun and relaxed. The website has an encouraging and easy going approach to the ways it interacts with the user.

## Features 
------

- Algebra Penguins Heading and Main Image
    - At the top of the page, the Algebra Penguins logo and image immediately let the user know that they're on a Maths website which has a game to play.

- The Guidelines Section
    - The guidelines clearly explain how the game works and how the user can interact and play the game.

    ![guidelines](assets/documentation-webp/guidelines.webp) 

- The Game Section
    - This is where the game will be played. It included multiple buttons, to start the game, reset the game, choose difficulty (easy or normal) and submit their answer.
    - Before the game starts, the only button which is enabled and clickable is the start button. This encourages the user to click the start button to engage with the game content.

    ![game start](assets/documentation-webp/start-game.webp)

- Timer
    - The timer is triggered by clicking the Start button and can be reset at any point after then with the Reset button.
    - The Start button will be made disabled whilst the timer is running, so users cannot launch two timers at once.
    - The Reset button is disabled until the start button is clicked and can be clicked anytime whilst the timer is running.
    - The timer itself is hidden from view until the Start button is clicked. At that point, the timer will start running and show between the Start and Reset buttons.

- Difficulty Section
    - The difficulty section shows us two buttons, easy and normal. Allowing users to choose which difficulty they'd like to be challenged with.

    ![difficulty](/assets/documentation-webp/difficulty-section.webp)

    - The easy difficulty is always a random number between 1-5 multiplied by the value of 'n' which is a random number that is calculated in the javascript and not on view to the user.

    ![easy equation](assets/documentation-webp/easy.webp)

    - The normal difficulty is always random number between 1-12 multiplied by the value of 'n' then with a random operator (either + or -) which adds or subtracts a secondary random number between 1-10. 

    ![normal equation](assets/documentation-webp/normal.webp)

- Equation Section
    - This is where the equation is displayed clearly, so the user can quickly work out the value of 'n'.
    - The game by default starts with the Normal equation. This is how the normal equation looks in full view of the game section.

    ![normal equation 2](assets/documentation-webp/normal-equation.webp)

    - The user can then choose whether they want to work out normal equations or easy by clicking the associated easy or normal buttons. Once clicked, this equation will repeat unless otherwise specified (by clicking the opposite button). This how the easy equation looks in full view of the game section.

    ![easy equation 2](assets/documentation-webp/easy-equation.webp)

- User input section
    - This is where the user can input a number of their choosing to guess the value of 'n' and then submit that answer for evaluation.
    - The answer will also be evaluated if the user presses the enter key instead of clicking the submit button.

    ![user submit](assets/documentation-webp/input.webp)

- The score section
    - The score will tally up the score of the player as they answer each correct answer.
    - This section shows the current score that the user has. The game gives 2 points for every normal difficulty equation answered correctly and 1 point for every easy difficulty equation answered correctly. 

    ![score](assets/documentation-webp/score.webp)

- The Answer Indicator
    - The answer indicator clearly shows the user whether their most recent answer was either correct or not, and if not will tell them the correct answer. This appears next to the scoreboard.

- Alerts
    - This game utilises alerts to interact encouragingly and informatively with the user.
    - There are a few different instances when the alerts are triggered.
    - When the user has finished the game an alert will be triggered notifying the user of their score.

    ![alert score positive](/assets/documentation-webp/score-positive.webp)

    - If the user didn't get any answers correct and their score is 0 when the timer runs out a different alert is triggered which encourages the user to try again.

    ![alert score zero](/assets/documentation-webp/score-zero.webp)

    - If the user presses the enter key after the game timer has ran out, then the following alert will show.
